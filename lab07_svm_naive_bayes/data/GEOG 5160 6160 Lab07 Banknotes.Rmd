### Logistic regression in **mlr3**

We will now switch to using the **mlr3** package that we introduced last week. As a quick reminder, this follows the ML workflow, and requires that we set up

- A *task* that defines the data to be used and the outcome variable
- A *learner* that defines the algorithm to be used
- A *resampling strategy* to validate the algorithm
- A *performance measure* to test how well the model fits to the training data and predicts the test data.

Start by loading the necessary packages

```{r}
banknote = read.csv("banknote_data.csv")
banknote$forgery = as.factor(banknote$forgery)
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)
```

Now let's define the task. As this is a classification task, we will use `TaskClassif()`. Note that we will be using this same task for all algorithms in this lab, so we only need to do this once:

```{r eval=TRUE}
task_bn = TaskClassif$new(id = "banknote", backend = banknote, 
                               target = "forgery")
```


```{r}
learner = lrn("classif.log_reg",  predict_type = "prob")
measure = msr("classif.auc")
resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 5)
resampling$instantiate(task_bn)
rr = resample(task_bn, learner, resampling, store_models = TRUE)
rr$score(measure)
rr$aggregate(measure)
```

## Naive Bayes

```{r}
learner = lrn("classif.naive_bayes", predict_type = "prob")
measure = msr("classif.auc")
resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 5)
resampling$instantiate(task_bn)
rr = resample(task_bn, learner, resampling, store_models = TRUE)
rr$score(measure)
rr$aggregate(measure)
```

## SVM

```{r}
learner = lrn("classif.svm", kernel = "radial", scale = TRUE, 
              predict_type = "prob", gamma = 0.01)
measure = msr("classif.auc")
resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 5)
resampling$instantiate(task_bn)
rr = resample(task_bn, learner, resampling, store_models = TRUE)
rr$score(measure)
rr$aggregate(measure)
```
