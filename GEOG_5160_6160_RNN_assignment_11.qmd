# Recurrent neural network assignment

For this exercise, you will need to submit evaluation scores for the 5 models listed in lab 11 (Recurren neural networks). These models are:

- Model 1: Dense network
- Model 2: Simple LSTM
- Model 3: LSTM with multiple time steps
- Model 4: Adding recurrent dropouts
- Model 5: Stacked LSTM

The easiest way to submit this will be as a table in Word, with the model experiment number and corresponding MAE from evaluation.
